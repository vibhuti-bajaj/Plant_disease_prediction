The "Innovative Approach to Plant Disease Classification" project introduces a groundbreaking solution for agricultural challenges by leveraging advanced machine learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and MobileNetV2. Traditional plant disease diagnosis methods are often marred by inefficiencies, prompting our dual-model approach. Utilizing CNNs ensures unparalleled precision in disease identification, while MobileNetV2 enhances efficiency, making the system adaptable to resource-constrained agricultural environments. With objectives to revolutionize classification, enhance accuracy and efficiency, and ensure adaptability to emerging diseases, this project holds promise for a resilient, sustainable, and technology-driven future in agriculture.
